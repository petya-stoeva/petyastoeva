  "info": "Hi, I’m Petya!<br />I’m currently a Data Analyst at Wayfair, where I use data and code to uncover insights, automate workflows, and support marketing decision-making. I recently earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from Boston College. <br /><br />I’m passionate about Software Engineering, Robotics, and Artificial Intelligence, and I’m always seeking opportunities that will allow me to grow as a developer while building meaningful, user-focused technology. My goal is to deepen my expertise through hands-on experience—particularly in collaborative, product-driven environments. After gaining a few years of industry experience, I plan to pursue a Master’s degree in Computer Science to further specialize.<br /><br />In my free time, I like to learn languages through Duolingo and to play chess and the guitar! I am also a part of the Bulgarian Dance ensemble, Ludo Mlado, in Boston. In the past, I volunteered at Life Care Center of Stoneham and Bulgarian School of Boston 'Sv. Sv. Kiril i Metodii.'"

How can we find a better way for BC students to gain career advice and job opportunities from BC alumni?' While there are many other websites for networking including LinkedIn and Handshake, they rely on cold messaging, which is especially difficult when you are not sure you are contacting the right people in the right sectors. Eagle Connect solves these problems by allowing both alumni and students to reach out, establishing common ground and shared interests. It is a React web application with a MangoDB database.

It allows users to filter courses based on various criteria, create watchlists, and receive email notifications when a selected class meets the criteria for open seats. Admins can review requests, open and close the system, and access and save detailed reports on student activities. The project integrates Auth0 for Google authentication, AP Background Scheduler for API calls and email notifications, and offers the option to export schedules as PDF files for convenience. It was deployed using Railway but the monthly payments to keep the site live were recently stopped. It is still available in GitHub.",

More specifically, ‘a’ corresponds to the bass drum, ‘s’ to the snare drum, and ‘d’ to the hi-hat. To run the program, the user must run Driver.java. First the file will output a little welcome design to the console. I used the Ascii Art website for the picture of the drum on the design.txt file and an Ascii text generator website for the ascii text also (see all citations on the last page). Then the user is prompted to enter a drum sequence, which again is simply a chain of the letters a, s, or d. Then they must enter a reasonable tempo, meaning a positive number between 40 and 240. After that they have the option of playing their “beat” on loop, until they enter the key “q” during any point or just playing it once through.",
